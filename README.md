## Testing üîç

### Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, ensure that you have Maven installed and run the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will run the unit tests for the application, including the functions for adding, updating, deleting, and viewing expenses.

### Mocking File Writes

The application uses a local JSON file to persist expenses. During testing, you can mock the file operations using `Mockito` to avoid writing to the file.

### Testing Frameworks Used
- **JUnit 5**: For unit testing.
- **Mockito**: For mocking dependencies (e.g., file operations).
